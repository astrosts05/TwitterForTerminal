# Install Guide

Windows:

    Make sure that you have Python installed on your Windows machine, you can check by pressing the windows key, typing "cmd" and pressing enter. Once the CMD window is open,       type "python", if you get an error, than you must install Python using the Microsoft store
    
    After confirming that Python is installed, you must confirm pip is installed by typing "python3 -m pip --version"
    
    Once you've confirmed that pip is installed, type "python3 -m pip install tweepy"
    
    Now, all you have to do to run the code is link it to a Twitter developer account and swap out the empty credentials in my code with the credentials of the new Twitter             developer account (https://realpython.com/twitter-bot-python-tweepy/#creating-twitter-api-authentication-credentials)
    
    Finally, after everything is setup, type "python3 index.py" in the directory that contains the index.py file

    After pip is done, type 'python3 -m pip install tweepy'
    
    Now, all you have to do to run the code is link it to a Twitter developer account and swap out the empty credentials in my code with the credentials of the new Twitter           developer account (https://realpython.com/twitter-bot-python-tweepy/#creating-twitter-api-authentication-credentials)
